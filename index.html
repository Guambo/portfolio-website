                        Arcade mobile game made using Unity2D Game Engine, C#, and Aseprite over the course of one month. The objective
                        is to avoid an endless wave of oncoming obstacles by jumping over them. Each obstacle you jump over rewards you
                        with 1 point. So far I've published the game to the Google Play Store and Itch.io (See link above). The next
                        step for this game is to integrate an online leaderboard system using google play services so people can compete
                        with others worldwide for the highest score.

                        Made using Unity2D Game Engine and C#. Art assets were made using Aseprite. I spent around 2-3 months tweaking the movement code to make the player movement feel <i>just</i> right. If you aren't familiar with what a platformer is then think of the old 2D Mario series. The players objective is to move the character from point A (the level spawn point) to point B (the end of the level). The problem that you are trying to solve in platformers is "how do I make going from point A to point B interesting?" For this prototype, I wanted to focus on creating solid movement mechanics, including wall-jumping, wall-sliding, and dashing. With these features the player can interact with the environment in an interesting way. Plus, having these features leads to more interesting level design. In other words, the key to platformers is to first have solid, fundamental player movement mechanics. Then, and only then, can you start focusing on how to make going from point A ot point B interesting.
